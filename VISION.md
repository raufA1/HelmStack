# Vision

Build a document-first, elastic project workspace that:
- turns any set of docs into an actionable plan,
- keeps persistent memory inside the repo,
- supports daily flow + research with human approval,
- stays tool-agnostic and offline-friendly.

Success = shorter time-to-plan, consistent execution, clear decisions, zero context loss.
