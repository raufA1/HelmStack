- OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
- Password reset functionality !
- Two-factor authentication (future enhancement)

## Epic: Project Management
- Create and manage projects
- Invite team members to projects
- Project settings and configuration
- Project analytics and reporting ‼
- Project templates
- Archive/restore projects

## Epic: Task Management
- Create, edit, delete tasks
- Task assignment and reassignment
- Task status tracking (Todo, In Progress, Review, Done)
- Task priorities (Low, Medium, High, Critical) ‼
- Task due dates and reminders
- Task comments and activity log
- Bulk task operations
- Task templates

## Epic: Team Collaboration
- Real-time updates using WebSocket
- In-app notifications
- Team member profiles
- Activity feeds
- @mentions in comments !
- File attachments on tasks
- Integration with Slack/Discord

## Epic: Reporting & Analytics
- Project progress dashboards
- Team productivity metrics
- Burndown charts
- Time tracking integration
- Export reports (PDF, CSV)
- Custom dashboard widgets

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend (React)
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Material-UI or Ant Design component library
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Query for data fetching
- WebSocket client for real-time updates
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support !

### Backend (Node.js)
- Node.js with Express.js
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Redis for caching and session storage
- WebSocket server (Socket.io)
- JWT authentication
- File upload handling (AWS S3 or similar)
- Rate limiting and security middleware

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- Docker containerization ‼
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Database migrations
- Environment configuration
- Logging and monitoring
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time < 200ms for most operations
- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- GDPR compliance for user data
- Mobile responsive design
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## User Stories

### As a Project Manager
- I want to create projects and invite team members
- I want to see project progress and team productivity
- I want to generate reports for stakeholders

### As a Developer
- I want to see my assigned tasks in priority order
- I want to update task status and add comments
- I want to receive notifications about relevant updates

### As an Admin
- I want to manage user accounts and permissions
- I want to configure system settings
- I want to monitor system performance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (4 weeks)
- Basic authentication
- Project and task CRUD operations
- Simple dashboard
- Basic team collaboration

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (3 weeks)
- Real-time updates
- Advanced task management
- Reporting dashboard
- Mobile optimization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3 weeks)
- Analytics and metrics
- Integrations
- Advanced security features
- Performance optimization

## Technology Stack Decisions Needed
- UI component library choice ‼
- Database schema design
- Real-time architecture approach
- Authentication strategy
- Deployment platform selection
- Monitoring and logging tools

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Complex real-time synchronization
  **Mitigation**: Use proven WebSocket libraries and implement conflict resolution

- **Risk**: Database performance with large datasets
  **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, indexing, and caching strategies

- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities
  **Mitigation**: Regular security audits, dependency updates, penetration testing

## Success Criteria
- Complete user authentication flow
- Create and manage tasks efficiently
- Real-time collaboration works smoothly
- Mobile responsive interface
- Deploy to production environment
- Achieve target performance metrics
